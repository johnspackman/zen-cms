 * @property {number} lineYStart The Y position of the line we are currently rendering or about to render, from the top of the parent widget

 * @property {number} availWidth Maximum available width of the line, dependent on the parent widget
 * @property {zx.ui.layout.evenflow.EvenFlowLayout} layoutMgr Layout manager of the widget we are rendering the children for
 * @property {qx.ui.core.Widget[]} childrenToRender Queue of children that are left to be positioned and rendered

 * @property {qx.ui.core.Widget} widget The widget that was added to the line
 * @property {number} initialLeft The horizontal position of the widget when it was added to the line in the first pass
 * @property {number} finalWidth The final calculated width of the widget after the second pass (currently, widget's width doesn't change)
